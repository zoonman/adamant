adamant
=======

My try to create a skeleton for development web-apps. 
The zen of this thing - simplicity, speed and convinience.
Now is only begin of the way. 

I have installed it on localhost with adamant hostname.
The default query in my config looks
`http://adamant/`
If we want to call index method in fire controller
`http://adamant/common/fire`
To call another method we can pass it as last parameter
`http://adamant/common/fire/high`
